A system which seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves. This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living.Through this book not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives he also tells us about the Sutras a step-by-step self help & self improvement guide to navigating our way in this challenging world.

Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, 'the world's most influential living psychologist' (Steven Pinker) revolutionised our understanding of human behaviour with <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>.

A system which seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves. This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living.Through this book not only does Sadhguru explain what Karma is and how we can use its concepts to enhance our lives he also tells us about the Sutras a step-by-step self help & self improvement guide to navigating our way in this challenging world. In the process we get a deeper richer understanding of life and the power to craft our destinies.
